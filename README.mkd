Enact
=====

Enact is a CSS selector-based templating system.
It is strongly based on [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive), a library for Clojure.

Content (HTML documents or raw strings) are modified using selections, and transformation functions.
Transformation functions can be any Python function/method you like.
